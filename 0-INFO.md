## Description

In this mini project, we'll be creating something similar to Google Drive. There shall be 3 pages, landing, login/registration and main page where all the files uploaded by the user will be shown. Kapil is supposed to design the UI and send it over by Sunday. Based on this design, people in the frontend department shall work on the pages.

Landing page is basically a home page containing small description of the project, features etc. Login/registration page will ask for username/password. Lalit is expected to implement it using MySQL/MongoDB, i.e. he is responsible for user authentication. Once the user is authenticated, they shall be redirected to the main page where they can view their files, and upload/delete them.

Vedang is responsible to developing the backend code in Java for encrypting the uploaded files and decrypting the downloaded files. These files will be stored in Hadoop File System (HDFS) which shall be handled by Sonali, Prajakta and Poonam.

We are planning to make this a good enough project so that we can maybe open source it and make it a part of our resume. Therefore it is important that y'all work sahi se and finish your stuff by the deadlines. We are expected to finish the entire project ✨ before IN-SEM exam ✨

While you are working on the project, note down the things you are doing so that we can provide it to the people doing the documentation.
